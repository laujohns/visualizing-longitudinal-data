#The commented code in this repository shows how to:

##Create spaghetti plots that visualize individual changes in hormones across pregnancy for those who delivered term and those who delivered preterm

##Create plots to show the nonlinear trends in hormones across pregnancy for those who delivered term and preterm using LOESS smoothing

##Create plots that visualize the variation in the mean hormone levels by age group
### *Asterisks indicate a significant difference in hormone levels compared to the reference based on linear mixed models with a random intercept for each subject (accounts for intra-individual correlation of repeated measures over time).
